# E-Health
an Android app that connect to a hardware home hospitalization system via Bluetooth and enable users to view vital signs data of patients received from the hardware system and send it to an online database for storage.
It also displays a history of all measurements taken in the past days, and allows users to stay in contact with their doctor by sending reports and receiving treatments.

The doctors can log in and view all the measurements associated with the patients they are responsible for. The data is presented as graphs or charts to make it easier to diagnose. 
The app also allows them to contact the patients and provide instructions or medication as needed.
